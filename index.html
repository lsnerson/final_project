      <p> Throughout my life, I have enjoyed creating custom playlists for myself, my friends, and my family. My playlists are a way for me to express myself and show appreciation for music of all  genres. I know this is something I will continue to do and I am always excited to hear new music. This webiste will lay out some of my favorite paylists I have created and highlight some of the inspiration behind my love for music. As you will see, I enjoy music and creating playlists through all aspects of my life.  </p>
